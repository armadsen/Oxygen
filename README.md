# Oxygen

This was a super quick and dirty projec to read oxygen saturation levels from a Nonin 9600 oxygen saturation meter. It is very much unfinished. I'm making public mostly because I need to free up a private repository slot on my GitHub account. If you find it interesting or useful, great.

It is of course provided with no warranty whatsoever.
